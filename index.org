#+title: sequent1

---------

- a prototype functional language
  which uses sequent calculus as its dependent type system

- [[http://xieyuheng.github.io][XIE Yuheng]] created

---------

* code

  - [[./sequent1.html][the implementation]] written in scheme

  - [[./example.html][example code]] in sequent1

  - [[https://github.com/xieyuheng/sequent1][source code]] on github

* reading

  - [[http://xieyuheng.github.io/math/function-compose-type-cut.html][function compose, type cut, and the algebra of logic]]
    this reading is also used to form a [[./reading/function-compose-type-cut.pdf][paper]] for [[http://scheme2016.snow-fort.org/][scheme workshop 2016]]
    and a [[./reading/demo.html][demo]] for the talk at the workshop

  - [[http://xieyuheng.github.io/math/term-lattice.html][term lattice -- the meaning of equality]]
    a summarization of the structure obtained by composing
    the subsumption lattice and the abstract rewriting system
    I simply call it term lattice
    this reading helps to understand the implementation of sequent1
